Title Ideas:
Wars3D

General Ideas:
	-Ideally print clear bases that have lights underneath. Can have raspberry pi light up available moves?
	-Have area to hold phones that will have an app that accompanies the game.
	-Expandable boards that attach to each other. Phone holder attaches to any of these
	-Pieces that can go on certain terrain should be able to go onto them. E.g. infantry should be able to fit into forest and mountain pieces, tanks can not.
	-Pieces are either magnetized or snap-in
	-I think the characters should be separate from the tiles, and they should have a pole underneath them with the magnet in it. The pole can vary in length
	 such that certain pieces won't fit on certain terrain. This way it's easier to move pieces around on the board. Then can also have static data on each tile
	 indicating the terrain cost and perhaps the health of the character on that tile. (Or ideally find a way to store that characters health on the character
	 itself).
	-Have base pieces that can go over other pieces. Thought is that if you have money, you can spend an infantry's turn to build a base.
	-Pick up one-time usable items on the map? E.g. ammo, health, bombs
	-Limit ammo to just 3 turns? Maybe have buttons pop-up that can be depressed each turn you shoot. Would probably need whole tile pieces to move in this case.

App stuff:
  -Ultimate charge
  -Each character's health?
  -Battle calculations
  -Generate map layouts
  -Keep track of money generation / expenditures

Pieces:
 Generally: 
	-Have something on them to indicate health (1-10 or 1-5 if I can't get that to work). Maybe a slider along the side of the piece
	-Have ammo?

 Character pieces:
 - Infantry (upgradeable so can have more than one person on it?)
	- $1000
 - Jeeps
	- Strong against infantry, weak against tanks
	- $3000
 - Tanks
	- Strong against infantry/tanks, weak against bombers
	- $6000
 - Bombers
	- Strong against infantry, tanks, and jeeps. (expensive)
	- Weak against anti-aircraft and jets
	- $10,000
 - Jets
	- Strong against bombers, medium vs others, weak against anti-aircraft
	- $9,000
 - Anti-aircraft
	- Strong against aircraft, weak against jeeps/infantry
	- $5000
 
 Terrain:
 - Grass
 - Concrete
 - Desert
 - Mountains
 - Forest
 - Bases

Printing:
  - My print-bed is 25cm long, 20cm tall. I'd like to make 5cm by 5cm tile pieces. So, for the corner pieces of my board, I should have them total less than 50cm long by 40cm tall. So I can do 9 tiles (45cm tile-space) long, 7 tiles (35cm tile-space) tall. So make each corner piece: ? (Need to factor in the sides first. Design then decide.)
  - Clear filament would be cool so can have led lights underneath. Raspberry pi or arduino to calculate which lights should light up.
  - Bombers and jets should be on springs so they're elevated
  
TODO:
  - Finish designing pieces
  - Make mountain pieces taller
  - Assign range to pieces and tiles
