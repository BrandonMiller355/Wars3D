Title Ideas:
Wars3D

General Ideas:
	-Ideally print clear bases that have lights underneath. Can have raspberry pi light up available moves?
	-Have area to hold phones that will have an app that accompanies the game.
	-Expandable boards that attach to each other. Phone holder attaches to any of these
	-Pieces that can go on certain terrain should be able to go onto them. E.g. infantry should be able to fit into forest and mountain pieces, tanks can not.	
	-Pieces are either magnetized or snap-in

App stuff:
  -Ultimate charge
  -Each character's health?
  -Battle calculations
  -Generate map layouts

Pieces:
 Generally: Have something on them to indicate health (1-10 or 1-5 if I can't get that to work)

 Character pieces:
 - Infantry (upgradeable so can have more than one person on it?)
	- $1000
 - Jeeps
	- Strong against infantry, weak against tanks
	- $3000
 - Tanks
	- Strong against infantry/tanks, weak against bombers
	- $6000
 - Bombers
	- Strong against everything except jets (expensive)
	- Weak against anti-aircraft
	- $10,000
 - Jets
	- Strong against bombers, medium vs others, weak against anti-aircraft
	- $9,000
 - Anti-aircraft
	- Strong against aircraft, weak against jeeps/infantry
	- $5000
 
 Terrain:
 - Grass
 - Concrete
 - Desert
 - Mountains
 - Forest
 - Bases

Printing:
  - Clear filament would be cool so can have led lights underneath
  - Bombers and jets should be on springs so they're elevated
